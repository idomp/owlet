A Home Assistant custom integration for the Owlet Smart Sock 2, Smart Sock 3 and Dream Sock, using the Owlet cloud.

> [!NOTE]
> This is the maintained continuation of [ryanbdclark/owlet](https://github.com/ryanbdclark/owlet) by [Ryan Clark (@ryanbdclark)](https://github.com/ryanbdclark), which was archived in July 2026. A big thank you to Ryan for building this integration and the [pyowletapi](https://github.com/ryanbdclark/pyowletapi) library it relies on, and for keeping it running for years. We are happy to take it over and keep maintaining it from here, see [Credits](#credits).

> [!WARNING]
> **This is not a medical device.** Data reaches Home Assistant by polling the Owlet cloud, which can be delayed, stop without warning or break when Owlet changes its private API. Never rely on this integration for alarms. Keep the Owlet base station and the official Owlet app as your primary alert.

## Requirements

- Home Assistant 2025.12 or newer, any installation type (OS, Supervised, Container, Core)
- [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/)
- An Owlet account with at least one Smart Sock 2, Smart Sock 3 or Dream Sock

## Installation

1. In HACS, open the menu (three dots) and choose **Custom repositories**.
2. Add `https://github.com/lucasvollebergh/owlet` with type **Integration**.
3. Search for **Owlet Smart Sock** in HACS and download it.
4. Restart Home Assistant.
5. [![Add Integration][add-integration-badge]][add-integration] or go to **Settings > Devices & services > Add integration** and search for **Owlet Smart Sock**.
6. Pick your region (Europe for accounts created in the EU or UK, World otherwise) and log in with your Owlet app credentials.

## Migrating from ryanbdclark/owlet

The domain (`owlet`) and all unique ids are unchanged, so existing entities, dashboards and automations keep working.

1. In HACS, open the old Owlet repository and choose **Remove** (this does not delete your config entry).
2. Add this repository as a custom repository and download it, see above.
3. Restart Home Assistant.

If the options dialog failed to open before (a known issue on Home Assistant 2025.12 and later), it works again after migrating.

## Entities

Per sock:

| Type | Entities |
| --- | --- |
| Sensor | Heart rate, O2 saturation, O2 saturation 10 minute average, skin temperature, sleep state, battery percentage, battery remaining, signal strength, last reading, movement and movement bucket (disabled by default) |
| Binary sensor | Charging, base station on, awake, sock off, high/low heart rate alert, high/low/critical oxygen alert, low/critical battery alert, lost power alert, sock disconnected alert, data stale |

Which entities appear depends on what your sock reports. Vitals are unavailable while the sock is charging.

There is no switch. This integration never changes anything on the base station: the only thing it ever writes to the Owlet cloud is the `APP_ACTIVE` flag that tells the base station a client is watching. The base station state is a read-only binary sensor.

### Stale data detection

Users have reported values that stop changing while the Owlet app still shows live data. When the Owlet cloud keeps returning an old reading, a heart rate looks "frozen". The integration judges every reading by the timestamp the cloud attached to it (`REAL_TIME_VITALS` on the Smart Sock 3 and Dream Sock, each vital's own timestamp on the Smart Sock 2):

- A reading is **fresh** when that timestamp is within the stale data threshold. A reading without a timestamp, with an unreadable one, or with one more than a minute in the future is never fresh: when its age cannot be established it is not trusted.
- Only fresh readings are shown. When the reading goes stale **everything taken from it becomes unavailable**: the vitals, the sleep state, the battery, the charging and base station state and every alert sensor. An alert can never stay "on" because the cloud stopped updating.
- **Data stale** (binary sensor) turns on when readings are expected but no fresh one arrived. Whether readings are expected (sock not charging, base station on) is taken from the last *fresh* reading only, so an old reading cannot claim "charging" to silence the warning. The sensor's attributes say why (`reading_status`), when the last reading was, how old it is and whether readings were expected.
- The check also runs when a reading ages out between two polls, so a long polling interval never keeps a frozen value visible.
- **Last reading** (sensor) shows when the cloud last received data and stays available while the data is stale.

### Repairs

When the data stays stale for more than an hour while the sock should be sending readings, a warning appears under **Settings > System > Repairs** with the time of the last reading. It disappears by itself once fresh readings arrive, and never appears when the stale data threshold is set to 0.

## Blueprints

Ready-made automations, import them with one click (requires the Home Assistant Companion app for notifications):

| Blueprint | What it does | Import |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Owlet alert notification | Notification when one of the selected Owlet alerts turns on, optionally as a critical notification that sounds on silent/do not disturb. | [![Import blueprint](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Flucasvollebergh%2Fowlet%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fautomation%2Fowlet%2Fowlet_alert_notification.yaml) |
| Owlet stale data notification | Notification when the Data stale sensor turns on (after an optional extra delay), and optionally when readings are back. | [![Import blueprint](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Flucasvollebergh%2Fowlet%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fautomation%2Fowlet%2Fowlet_stale_data_notification.yaml) |

These notifications depend on Home Assistant polling the Owlet cloud and can be delayed. They do not replace the Owlet base station and app.

## Dashboard

Two ready-made dashboards are included. Both only use built-in cards, so no custom cards need to be installed.

| File | Language | What it shows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`dashboards/owlet_nl.yaml`](dashboards/owlet_nl.yaml) | Dutch | Two views. **Baby:** heart rate, O2 and skin temperature tiles with 6 hour trend graphs, sleep state, awake, battery, sock and base station status, and Owlet alerts that only show while active. **Trends:** the last 12 hours of heart rate, O2 and skin temperature, a sleep timeline, daily min/mean/max over 30 days and 48 hours of battery. This is the dashboard in the screenshots above. |
| [`dashboards/owlet.yaml`](dashboards/owlet.yaml) | English | One view with heart rate and O2 gauges, active Owlet alerts, the last 12 hours of heart rate, O2 and sleep, daily min/mean/max of heart rate, O2 and skin temperature over 30 days, and battery and signal. |

Pick the file that matches the language of your Home Assistant. Home Assistant generates entity ids from the entity names in the language it runs in, so a Dutch installation has `sensor.<prefix>_hartslag` and an English one `sensor.<prefix>_heart_rate`.

### Installing a dashboard

1. **Find your prefix.** Go to **Settings > Devices & services > Owlet Smart Sock**, open your sock and click the heart rate entity, then the cog. The entity id is shown there. The prefix is everything between `sensor.` and the entity name:

   | Entity id | Prefix |
   | --- | --- |
   | `sensor.owlet_sock_ab12cd34_heart_rate` | `owlet_sock_ab12cd34` |
   | `sensor.nursery_owlet_sock_ab12cd34_heart_rate` (newer releases add the area) | `nursery_owlet_sock_ab12cd34` |
   | `sensor.slaapkamer_owlet_sok_hartslag` (Dutch, renamed device) | `slaapkamer_owlet_sok` |

2. **Prepare the YAML.** Open the dashboard file on GitHub, copy it into a text editor and replace every `owlet_sock_serial_number` with your prefix (find and replace all).
3. **Create the dashboard.** Go to **Settings > Dashboards > Add dashboard > New dashboard from scratch**, give it a name and open it from the sidebar.
4. **Paste it.** Choose the pencil (Edit dashboard), then the three dots > **Raw configuration editor**, replace everything with your YAML and save.

A card that says "Entity not available" means that entity id does not match: check it on the device page and correct it in the raw configuration editor. The critical oxygen and critical battery alerts only exist on socks that report them, their cards stay hidden otherwise.

With more than one sock, duplicate the views and use the prefix of the other sock. The daily statistics start from the moment the integration is installed, so the trends fill up over time.

Gauge ranges and trend graphs are for display only and have no medical meaning. Alerts come from Owlet itself.

## Options

**Settings > Devices & services > Owlet Smart Sock > Configure**

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Polling interval | 10 s | Seconds between requests to the Owlet cloud, minimum 5. Every poll costs several API calls per sock, a lower value raises the risk of rate limiting. |
| Stale data threshold | 5 min | Minutes without a new reading before the data is treated as stale. Set to 0 to disable. |

The integration also supports **Reconfigure** (change region or log in again) and asks you to log in again automatically when the Owlet session expires.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Invalid handler specified"** when adding the integration: this came from an incompatible external `pyowletapi` version in older releases. The Owlet API client now ships inside the integration, install the latest release of this repository and restart.
- **Values stop changing**: check the Data stale and Last reading entities. If the Owlet app shows fresh data but Home Assistant does not, download diagnostics (device page > three dots > Download diagnostics) and open an issue. Diagnostics redact tokens, email, serial numbers, MAC addresses and baby details.
- Enable debug logging:

  ```yaml
  logger:
    logs:
      custom_components.owlet: debug
      custom_components.owlet.owletapi: debug
  ```

## Known limitations

- Owlet has no public API. This integration uses the same private endpoints as the Owlet app, which Owlet can change or block at any time.
- The Owlet Cam is not supported.
- Only one Owlet account per Home Assistant config entry, add another entry for a second account.

## Credits

- **Original author:** [Ryan Clark (@ryanbdclark)](https://github.com/ryanbdclark) created this integration in [ryanbdclark/owlet](https://github.com/ryanbdclark/owlet) and the [pyowletapi](https://github.com/ryanbdclark/pyowletapi) library that talks to the Owlet cloud. Everything here builds on that work. Thank you, Ryan.
- **Contributors to the original repository:** everyone who sent fixes and translations upstream, including [@MarjovanLier](https://github.com/MarjovanLier) (multiple devices), [@Julien80](https://github.com/Julien80) (French translation) and [@coreywillwhat](https://github.com/coreywillwhat) (10 minute oxygen average filtering).
- **Owlet API client:** the integration ships its own copy of [lucasvollebergh/pyowletapi](https://github.com/lucasvollebergh/pyowletapi) (pyowletapi-ng), the maintained continuation of Ryan's library, in `custom_components/owlet/owletapi`, so Home Assistant does not need to install anything from PyPI.
